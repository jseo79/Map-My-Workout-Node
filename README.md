## Inspiration and Takeaways

All of my life I've been involved in fitness. In high school I played soccer and ran cross country, and even ran at state my junior and senior year. Although I didn't run competitively in college, I've always enjoyed running as a hobby. More recently, I started racing again, with my most recent race being the Chicago 13.1 half-marathon. As most running hobbyists might know, the holy grail of cardio-related apps is Strava. This app has pretty much everything you would want to know about your workouts, except for one thing, a proper way to visualize all of your workouts on a map. While I probably could have used the Strava API directly for a simpler integration along with other benefits, I felt that building my own app from the ground up would be a more beneficial learning experience. This ultimately brought me to the creation of Map My Workout.

Map My Workout was an opportunity for me to implement and practice my knowledge of how a full-stack application should function while learning some tools along the way. I developed the frontend using React and learned a lot about components, state management, and of course, how to build a visually pleasing interface. The backend was developed with Node.js and MySQL and I learned a lot about containerization with docker, API testing with Postman, and generally how REST APIs work. Overall, this project solidified a lot of my knowledge of various tools and concepts across the full-stack.
